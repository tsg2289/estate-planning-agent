# Authentication Flow Test

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Routing after login** - Now properly redirects to `/app` after successful authentication
2. **Email verification** - Made more lenient in development mode (only enforced in production)
3. **User context** - Updated EstatePlanningApp to use Supabase authentication
4. **Navigation** - Added user info and logout button in the header
5. **Loading states** - Added proper loading indicators during authentication

## 🧪 Test Steps

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the website:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001
   - You should see the landing page

3. **Test Registration:**
   - Click "Sign Up" or go to http://localhost:3001/register
   - Create a new account
   - You should see a success message about email verification

4. **Test Login:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/login
   - Sign in with your credentials
   - You should be automatically redirected to http://localhost:3001/app

5. **Test App Access:**
   - You should see the Estate Planning App interface
   - The header should show "Welcome, [your-email]"
   - You should see a "Sign Out" button
   - You should be able to access all the estate planning forms

6. **Test Logout:**
   - Click "Sign Out" in the header
   - You should be redirected back to the landing page

## 🔧 Development Mode Features

- **No email verification required** - You can sign in immediately after registration
- **Console logging** - Check browser console for authentication flow details
- **Mock Supabase** - If Supabase isn't configured, you'll see helpful setup instructions

## 🚀 Production Mode

When you deploy to production:
- Email verification will be required
- Real emails will be sent
- All security features will be enforced

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Set up Supabase project (if you want real authentication)
2. Configure environment variables
3. Test with real email verification
4. Deploy to production

Your authentication flow should now work perfectly! 🎉
