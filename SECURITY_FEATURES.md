# Security Features - Estate Planning Agent

## Overview
This estate planning application implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect sensitive user data and ensure secure authentication.

## Authentication Security

### Password Requirements
- **Minimum Length**: 8 characters
- **Complexity Requirements**:
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - At least one number (0-9)
  - At least one special character (!@#$%^&* etc.)

### Password Strength Indicator
- Real-time password strength validation
- Visual strength bars (1-5 levels)
- Color-coded feedback (Red → Orange → Yellow → Green → Dark Green)
- Immediate feedback on password requirements

### Session Management
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Automatic session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Secure token storage in localStorage
- Automatic token validation on app initialization

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- **AES-256 encryption** for sensitive data
- **HTTPS/TLS** for all communications
- **JWT tokens** for secure authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing (12 salt rounds)

### Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all user inputs
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- Email format validation
- Comprehensive error handling

## API Security

### Authentication Endpoints
- `/api/auth/register` - User registration with validation
- `/api/auth/login` - Secure login with credential verification
- `/api/auth/verify` - Token validation and user verification

### Security Headers
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Content-Security-Policy: Restrictive CSP

## Frontend Security

### Protected Routes
- Authentication required for dashboard access
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users
- Route protection with React Router

### Form Security
- Client-side validation with server-side verification
- Secure password input fields
- CSRF protection through proper form handling
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS
