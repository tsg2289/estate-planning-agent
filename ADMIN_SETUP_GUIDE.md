# Admin Panel Setup Guide

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive admin panel where you (thomas.st.germain22@gmail.com) can view all user signups and manage the system. Here's how to set it up:

## Step 1: Set Up Admin Database Functions

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `estate-planning-agent`
3. **Navigate to**: SQL Editor
4. **Copy and paste** the contents of `setup-admin-user.sql`
5. **Click "Run"** to execute the SQL

This will:
- ✅ Create admin role checking functions
- ✅ Set up automatic admin role assignment for your email
- ✅ Create secure functions to view user data
- ✅ Set up user statistics functions

## Step 2: Sign Up as Admin

1. **Go to your website**: https://estate-planning-agent-69nni3i6c-thomas-st-germains-projects.vercel.app/register
2. **Sign up** with email: `thomas.st.germain22@gmail.com`
3. **Complete email verification** (check your email)
4. **Your account will automatically be granted admin privileges**

## Step 3: Access Admin Panel

1. **Go to**: https://estate-planning-agent-69nni3i6c-thomas-st-germains-projects.vercel.app/admin
2. **You should see the admin dashboard** with user signup data

## What You Can See in the Admin Panel

### 📊 User Statistics Dashboard
- **Total Users**: Number of people who have signed up
- **Email Verified**: Users who completed email confirmation
- **Active Users**: Currently active user accounts
- **This Week**: New signups in the last 7 days

### 👥 User Signups Table
- **Email addresses** of all users who have signed up
- **Full names** (if provided)
- **Verification status** (confirmed email or pending)
- **Account status** (active/inactive)
- **Join date** and **last login time**
- **Special admin badge** for your account

### 🔄 Real-time Data
- **Refresh button** to get latest user data

- **Error handling** if database connection fails

## Features

### ✅ Implemented
- Supabase-based admin authentication

### 🚧 Future Enhancements

## Security Features

1. **Role-Based Access**: Only users with admin role can access the panel
2. **Supabase RLS**: All database queries are protected by Row Level Security
3. **Automatic Admin Assignment**: Your email is automatically granted admin privileges
4. **Secure Functions**: All user data is accessed through secure database functions

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Access Denied" when visiting /admin
**Solution**: Make sure you:
1. Signed up with `thomas.st.germain22@gmail.com`
2. Completed email verification
3. Ran the SQL setup script in Supabase

### Problem: No user data showing
**Solution**: 
1. Check that the SQL functions were created successfully
2. Make sure other users have signed up
3. Try the refresh button
4. Check browser console for errors

### Problem: "Configuration Required" error
**Solution**: Make sure Supabase environment variables are set in Vercel:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

## Testing the Admin Panel

1. **Create test users**: Sign up with different email addresses
2. **Check admin panel**: Go to `/admin` and verify you can see the users
3. **Test statistics**: Verify the user count statistics are accurate
4. **Test refresh**: Click refresh button to reload data

## Current Status

✅ **Admin authentication system** - Complete  
✅ **User signup tracking** - Complete  
✅ **Admin dashboard UI** - Complete  
✅ **Database security** - Complete  
⚠️ **Database setup** - Needs to be run in Supabase  
⚠️ **Admin user creation** - You need to sign up first  

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL setup script** in Supabase
2. **Sign up with your admin email**
3. **Test the admin panel**
4. **Deploy the changes** to production

The admin panel is ready to use once you complete the database setup!
